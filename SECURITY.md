## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

To report a security issue, open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/nik2208/awesome-python-checkout/security/advisories/new) (private disclosure). You can also use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button on the [Security tab](https://github.com/nik2208/awesome-python-checkout/security).

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected versions
- Any suggested fix, if you have one

## Response timeline

- **Acknowledgement** within 48 hours
- **Assessment and triage** within 5 business days
- **Fix and advisory** published after a patch is ready (coordinated disclosure)

## Scope

This policy covers the `awesome-python-checkout` PyPI package. It does **not** cover third-party dependencies — please report those directly to their respective maintainers.

## Security best practices for users

- Never commit provider credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `mac_key`, `private_key`) to source control.
- Rotate keys and secrets immediately if you suspect they have been exposed.
- Keep the library updated to receive security patches (`pip install --upgrade awesome-python-checkout`).
- Always validate webhook signatures in production (all built-in providers do this automatically).
- Use HTTPS in production to protect payment data in transit.
